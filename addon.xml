- Libraries/Photos: Fix wonky thumbnail display on photodirectories
- SeekDialog: Fix final credits marker skipping wrongly on manual marker skip
- SeekDialog: Fix several marker issues (over-jumping, invalid markers)
- SeekDialog: Show stream transport type in video session info (smb, nfs, path mapped, http(s))
- SeekDialog: Fix empty chapters list shown when watching an episode without markers via NEXT after watching one with markers
- SeekDialog/Settings: Add option to hide all time-related information from the user when the OSD isn't open

- Core: Advanced/Addon settings: Set default Plex requests timeout to 10 (was 5)
- Core/Mainloop: Make sure we were able to open the Home/UserSelect window after our BACKGROUND successfully opened, even if another modal dialog opened in the meantime
- Core: Firstrun: Refresh resources after signin and/or home user switch, otherwise the first time the addon's run the user sees no servers
- Core: UI: Fall back to black background image when we have backgrounds set but they didn't load
- Core: Finally fix and handle plex.direct mappings via advancedsettings.xml (might not work for Kodi 18, you'll need to exempt plex.direct from your router's DNS rebind protection list)
- Core: Fix issues resulting in new devices being registered with plex.tv on every plugin start
- Core: Only use mapped file path if mapped file exists or verification is off
- Core: Backgrounds: More concise fallback handling
- Core/Player: Add optional DirectPlay path mapping via addon_data/script.plexmod/path_mapping.json (path_mapping.example.json included in addon directory). Allows for arbitrary replacements of HTTP playback with SMB, NFS, local mounts etc.
- Home: Rework and simplify section/library change logic
- Home: Never update hubs while playing a video to avoid hickups in high bitrate scenarios
- Home: Properly cache user thumbnail (by removing the ?c timestamp from the URL), increasing performance
- Home: Fix round robining on hubs (going left once before the last item, then right falsely round-robined to the start, early)
- Home: Add virtual hub 'home.VIRTUAL.movies.recentlyreleased' on index 3 if we encounter 'movie.recentlyreleased' on the home hubs
- Home/Settings: Add setting to use the modern Continue Watching hub on Home instead of the separated In Progress/On Deck hubs
- Episodes: Complete rework of the watch-state handler for TV; instantly update progress while watching
- Theme: Update assets, icon, splash
- Music: Rework music player and handler; remove plugin:// path and handle tracks directly; fixed all stability issues; massively improve performance
- Player: Add button theme support, use new modern colored theme; support custom themes
- Player: Improve handling when postplay screen is not wanted and we're at the end of a show; harden progressEvent handler
- Player: Remove all /file.xxx instances instead of just .mkv and .mp4 from non mapped stream URLs
- Musicplayer: Partially fix "dangling" playing tracks in Plex Dashboard after stopping playback
- Music: Hide spinner on prev/next button clicks as well (only with Plextuary skin 4.0.0-pm4k0.9 (omega), 3.0.10-pm4k0.8 (nexus and older))
- Settings: Add setting to toggle path mapping dynamically
- Settings: Adjust cache recommendations down from 100MB to 50MB
- AddonSettings: Add advanced setting to verify mapped files before playing them (default: on)
- Account/HomeUsers: Use new API to determine the PlexPass subscription status of the Plex Home

- Home/RefreshUsers/UserSelect: Refresh subscription state
