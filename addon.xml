        <news>
- Global: Use watched markers instead of unwatched markers (green checkmark vs. yellow triangle)
- Home: Blur in-progress episode thumbnails if Addon Setting “Use episode thumbnails in continue hub” is enabled and titles if requested
- Home: Refresh hubs when no episode spoiler setting changed
- Home/Settings: After changing home-relevant settings, reload Home on revisit, not immediately
- Home: Dynamically reload home when relevant settings have changed
- Home/Sections: Improve handling for sections that errored out once, and retry loading them just like any stale section every 5 minutes
- Home: Fix hubs not coming back after disconnect
- Home: Harden disconnect handling in general; PM4K should be able to "live" forever now
- Home: Refresh last section on: screensaver deactivated, DPMS deactivated, system wakeup after sleep
- Home/PowerEvents: Disable updates when system goes to sleep, enable them when it wakes up; force a hubs update when waking up
- Home: Probably fix long-running section change issue (partially reverting a previous change and being a little smarter about the current selection state); add debug logging for when we detect the "anomaly"
- Home: Don't let any tasks remain in a crashed state

- Home: Use ACTION_NAV_BACK/ACTION_PREVIOUS_MENU in home hubs to select the first item when any item other than the first item is selected
- Home: After refreshing stale section hubs (every 5m), re-select the last selected position in every hub, possibly re-extending the hubs to match the last position
- Episodes: Blur unwatched/in-progress episode thumbnails and redact spoiler texts, and episode titles if requested
- Episodes: Possibly use correct episode when playing TV Show from TV Show overview; always play latest in progress, unwatched, deprioritize specials
- Episodes: after watching an episode, remove chevron immediately
- Episodes: After watching multiple episodes in a row that span more than one season (e.g. watched S01E10, S02E01), properly redirect to the latest correct season view of the just watched episodes
- Episodes: Inject watched/progress state into listitem datasource (fixes wrong "Mark as (Un) Played" menu item behaviour immediately after watching an episode)

- Episodes: Select the correct episode after returning from direct playback from home (P/PLAY pressed)

- Core/Players: Remove all Kodi media-loading spinners when using Plextuary skin
- Core/Player: Always set infolabel "year" and remove it when downloading subtitles; don't set infolabels "episode" and "season" at all for non-TV-shows (fixes scrobbling issues with trakt plugin)
- Core/Player: Report all known Guids to script.trakt if it's installed; generate slug for movies
- Player/SeekDialog: Properly handle a manual stop action on episodes when OSD was visible (possibly other occasions)
- Player/PostPlay: Hide spoilers as well, if configured
